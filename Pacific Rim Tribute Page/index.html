        <h2> Film Synopsis</h2>
        <p>In 2013, a breach in the Pacific Ocean acted as an interdimensional portal between earth and the precursor's home world, from which monsterous creatures known as the Kaiju emerged. In response to this threat, mankind built monsters of their own: giant mechs known as Jaegers. Two pilots who were deamed compatible are chosen to operate these robots by linking their minds together in a process known as "drifting". This allows the pilots to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.</p>
