      <header><h1>5. Other Requirements</h1></header>
      <p>Optional Feature: We are thinking to have a folder-like structure that would allow users within groups to organize their shared-files.</p>
      <p>Optional Requirement: Code must be readible. Examples of preferred programming styles are shown below:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li><code>/*This forloop is doing...*/<br>
        for(int i=10; i>=0; i--){System.out.println("blah");} </code></li>
        
        <li><code>/*The variables in the forloop are self explainatory*/<br>
        for(int numOfApples= 10; numOfApples>=0; numOfApples--){System.out.println("blah");} </code></li>
        
        <li><code>/*Avoid smelly code like the one below*/<br>
        public static int badCodeSmell(int x, int y){<br>
            int a = x;<br>
            int b = y;<br>
            int sum = 0;<br>
            int average = 0;<br>
            sum = a + b;<br>
            average = sum / 2;<br>
            return average;<br>
          } </code></li>
        
        <li><code>/*Instead, try to reduce redundancy as much as possible*/<br>
        public static int badCodeSmell(int x, int y, int count){<br>
            return ((x+y)/count);<br>
          } </code></li>
        
        <li><code>/*Indent whenever possible, avoid indenting like the code below*/<br>
          for(String number: numbers){for(int i=0; i&lt; number.length(); i++){System.out.println(i);}}</code></li>
